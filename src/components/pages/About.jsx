        <Paragraph>Hey! I'm <strong>Nicola</strong>, a 25 year old full-stack Software Engineer and UI/UX designer based in London, England.<br />Currently, I work at <strong>Apple</strong> as a Software Engineer for their Services division.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>I hold a Masters' Degree in Electronic Engineering with Computer Science from <strong>Univeristy College London (UCL)</strong>, where I graduated in September 2022. My thesis focused on the emulation of faults in novel neuromorphic devices to improve the resiliance of hardware-based neural networks. While my work at University focused on hardware, outside of University I spent my free time bringing ideas to life through software. Some of the projects I worked on are still up on my GitHub!</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Engineering is more than a profession to me â€” it's the bridge between art and science, capable of blending technology and human ingenuity with creativity and beauty. I love being able to blend the two in my projects to make ideas happen.</Paragraph>
